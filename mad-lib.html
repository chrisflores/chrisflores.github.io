		<p>Alice was beginning to get <span id="adjetive-1">(adjetive)</span> of <span id="verb-1">(verb)</span> by her sister on the bank, 

		and of <span id="verb-2">(verb)</span> nothing to <span id="verb-3">(verb)</span>: once or twice she had <span id="verb-4">(verb)</span> 

		into the <span id="noun-1">(noun)</span> her sister was reading,

		but it had no <span id="noun-2">(noun)</span> or <span id="noun-3">(noun)</span> in it, 'and what is the use of a <span id="noun-4">(noun)</span>,'

		thought Alice 'without <span id="noun-5">(noun)</span>or <span id="noun-6">(noun)</span>?'  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, 

		for the hot day made her feel very <span id="adjetive-2">(adjetive)</span> and <span id="adjetive-3">(adjetive)</span>),

		whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth

		the trouble of <span id="verb-5">(verb)</span> and <span id="verb-6">(verb)</span>, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink <span id="body-part">(body part)</span> ran close by her.

		There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice 

		think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 

		'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be <span id="adjetive-4">(adjetive)</span>)!' (when she thought it over afterwards,

		it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time

		it all seemed quite <span id="adjetive-5">(adjetive)</span>); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS <span id="clothing-1">(clothing piece)</span>)-POCKET, 

		and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it 

		flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a <span id="clothing-2">(clothing piece)</span>)-pocket,

		or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she <span id="verb-7">(verb)</span> across the <span id="noun-7">(noun)</span> after it, 

		and fortunately was just in time to see it <span id="verb-8">(verb)</span> down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
